# Product-Sales-Analysis

SQL-based sales data analysis focused on answering three business questions:

1. Which products are the primary drivers of profit, and where is capital being wasted in overstock?
2. Are we meeting our delivery promises, and where are the geographic bottlenecks?
3. Who are our "VIP" customers, and which sales reps are most effective at managing them?
